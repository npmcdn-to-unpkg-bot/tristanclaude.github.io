<h1>Resources</h1>
<p>I've been learning about minor front end development for a little while on and off. As most people know, there are quite a few different ways to do quite a few different things. CSS and HTML can be beautifully simple, or unbearably complex. If you haven't much experience and you'd like to delve in, avoid complexity and stive for simple conceptual understanding.</p>
<p>The best advice I can give anyone is this: Do it your way.</p><p> It's almost guarnteed that your "Insert Thing Here" journey won't be the same as the next person. Nobody has any clue (really) how you think, and they don't know what will work for you. One thing that I've learnt whilst diving through all the resources I've dived through, is that there isn't really any perfect way of doing things. And if there was, things wouldn't be so interesting. Find a goal. Like in wonderland (INSERT QUOTE) it really doesn't matter which road you take if you don't know where you're going. </p>
