    <h2>Hello there,</h2>
    <h3>Exordium / Preamble</h3>
    <p>I'm Tristan and this is my little website. At the moment it is a website that exists mostly for the sake of being a cozy corner for myself in the exquisite place that is the internet.</p>
    <p>Eventually I hope that it'll be of some use to others. Maybe my reviews of things will be useful, or the other things that I write and create may bring some sort of enjoyment. <!--I personally find the websites of other humans can be quite interesting. Their experiments, opinions, and design choices often bring me a pleasure of sorts.--> I haven't any clue who might gain something from perusing what is here, but I'm sure at least someone might.</p>
    <p>This website is a constant work in progress. To see a list of the things I'm currently working on, you can go <a href="#">here</a>. If you have any suggestions, ideas, or know of something that I could be doing much better, please feel free to send me a message.</p>
    <h3>What is here?</h3>
    <p>You can find my <a href="/words/">writing</a>, which consists mostly of short blog posts, reviews, and other bits. You'll also find a selection of <a href="/photos/">photos</a> that I've taken ranging from travel photography, portraits, and other personal work. There is a page with <a href="/projects/">projects</a> that I've done or have been working on. They vary and consist of typographic experiments, adventures in programming, other graphic related work, and more. On this page, you can find more information about me than is necessarry and links to a variety of different things. There is a <a href="/me/repository/">repository</a> of things I like, and the <a href="/other/">other</a> page for things that might not fit amongst the rest.
    <h3>Delving Further</h3>
    <p>I've been passionate about making nifty things as long as I can remember being able to make nifty things. As vague as nifty is - and thing too - they're the best words I've got. The passionately making probably started before nifty ever came into the equation. I think that's the case with most children. Nifty came into play when Lego did. Building, improving, iterating, and reimagining my Lego creations was the most emjoyable and fulfilling thing I could do until growing up got in the way.</p>
    <p id="could-be-expanded">Nowadays I'm not terribly specific about the nifty things I go about making. The realms I wander through tend to ebb and flow. I fancy things that are consciously designed and would love to get much deeper into a nice overflowing handful of different areas. It seems time is rarely on my side. I plan on learning quite a bit about typography and would be glad to use it professionally one day. I adore taking photos, especially of humans. I have a small portfolio of photos currently but I plan to feed it regularly. I adore graphic design, especially the concept of brand identity, user interface and experience design, and the way that form and function are in a constant and infinite dance. I would love to get into industrial design and learn so much more about it. There are so many everyday things that are designed beautifully or could be designed beautifully. I would love to learn more about fashion and contour fashion, and be able to choreograph the dance of form and function in that strange world. Programming, math, writing, and economics are other realms I find myself daydreaming about.</p>
    <p>I'm awfully curious about all the nifty things that can be done when designing. If you see something that can be improved upon within my site or any of my work, do let me know! I love constructive advice if it'll help me make or do better things.</p>
