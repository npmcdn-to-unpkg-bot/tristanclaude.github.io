<div id="home"><!--<p>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</p>--><h2>HELLO THERE</h2><p>Welcome to my little corner of the web. I'm a curious human being with a love for beauty and the infinitely interesting world we all live in. I'm passionate about a somewhat random miscellany of subjects and am currently focused on nothing in particular.</p>
<p>I love to make things and often enjoy overthinking things. I believe form is function, and function in itself can be a beautiful expression of form. Superfluity oft irks me, but it finds itself in many of my favourite creations. UI and UX design fascinates. I love the way that it can flow and bridge into everything that we come into contact with. I like to overthink things like menus, buttons, and how design often is content.</p>
<p>On this website you'll find various information about me, things I've written, photos I've taken, and some of the projects I've done and experiments I've made.</p></div>
