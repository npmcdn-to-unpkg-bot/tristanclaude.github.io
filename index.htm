    <p>Welcome to my little corner of the web. I'm a curious human being with a love for beauty and the infinitely interesting world we all live in. I'm passionate about a somewhat random miscellany of subjects and am currently focused on: <span id="focuson">staying sane.</span></p>
    <p>On this website you'll find various information about me, things I've written, photos I've taken, and some of the projects and experiments I've done.
    <!--
    <p>In the <a href="/abt">about</a> section you'll find a longer description about me, a repository of things I like, and other related things.</p>
    <p>In the <a href="/wrtng">writing</a> section you'll find a variety of pieces that I've written. Mostly short blog posts with occasional prose and poetry.</p>
    <p>In the <a href="/phtgrphs">photographs</a> section you'll find a variety of photos I've taken. They currently consistent mostly of travel photos and people. At some point there might be some examples of fashion work and landscape photography aswell.</p>
