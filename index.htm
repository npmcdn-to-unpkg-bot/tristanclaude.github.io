  <h3>Hello, I'm <span>Tristan</span>.</h3>
  <!-- <p>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefgh</p> -->
  <p>I like to make things, experience things, and think about things. Welcome to my little corner of the web. I'm a curious human being with a love for beauty and the infinitely interesting world we all live in. I'm passionate about a somewhat random miscellany of subjects and am currently focused on learning about web development, basic programming, and brushing up on some mathematics.</p><p>On this website you can find my <a href="/">photography</a>, <a href="/">writing</a>, <a href="/">projects</a> I have done, information about me and few other tidbits hear and there.</p>
